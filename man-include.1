[description]
Basic usage is to specify two strings and one or more filenames
on the command line.
The first string is the string to replace, and the second string is
the replacement string.

Filenames may include glob patterns (these must be quoted to
avoid being interpreted by the shell), and in particular may use ‘\fI**\fR’ to
match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. Tilde and
environment variable expansion is also performed.

[examples]
Replace all occurrences of the word ‘F’ with ‘A’
in all files with extension \fI.txt\fR under the
.I grades/
directory:
.PP
.nf
.RS
rpl \-wd 'F' 'A' 'grades/**/*.txt'
.RE
